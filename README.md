# Teals_Strain-Level_Metagenome_Pipeline
<b>Purpose:</b> Using a mixture of my Universal Reference Database, single- and co-assembly, novel software, and dereplication, this pipeline gives you
1. detailed community genes, functions, and phylogeny
2. differential analysis and visualization
3. strain(ish)-level MAGs

The fundamental process is always the same for metagenome pipelines: read QC, assembly, read coverage, bin.<br><br>
The devil is in the details... (see wiki).
