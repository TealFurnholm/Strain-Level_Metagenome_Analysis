# Teals_Strain-Level_Metagenome_Pipeline
<b>Purpose:</b>Using a mixture of my Universal Reference Database, single- and co-assembly, novel software, and dereplication, this pipeline gives you detailed community functions and strain(ish)-level MAGs.

The fundamental process is always the same for metagenome pipelines: read QC, assembly, read coverage, bin.<br> 
The devil is in the details... (see wiki).
